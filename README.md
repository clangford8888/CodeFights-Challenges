# CodeFights-Challenges

My solutions to various challenges from [Code Fights](https://codefights.com/challenges). I will add challenge discriptions and note whether my solution solved all of the various tests (hidden or otherwise) presented with the challenge.

Generally, challenges are posted daily with a 24 hour time limit and are of the algorithmic variety. Scoring is done in code golf fashion where the lowest number of characters wins.
